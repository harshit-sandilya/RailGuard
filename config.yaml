# RailGuard Simulation Configuration File
# This YAML file contains various configurable parameters for the RailGuard simulation.
# Each section defines a specific aspect of the simulation, such as entity settings, physics, train properties, and control system configurations.

# ============================================
# STATION CONFIGURATION
# ============================================
station:
    length: 250 # Station length in meters.
    width: 100  # Station width in meters.
    height: 100 # Station height in meters.

# ============================================
# SIMULATION TIME CONFIGURATION
# ============================================
time:
    seconds: 0.05 # Time scaling factor: 1 means real-time, 20 means simulation runs at 20x of real speed.

# ============================================
# PHYSICS CONFIGURATION
# ============================================
physics:
    friction-coefficient: 0.2 # The coefficient of friction for the train's interaction with the track.

# ============================================
# TRAIN CONFIGURATION
# ============================================
train:
    length: 300             # Train length in meters.
    width: 100              # Train width in meters.
    height: 100             # Train height in meters.
    mass: 500000            # Train's total mass in kilograms.
    hp: 120000              # Train's horsepower (power output of the engine).
    brake-force: 634500     # Maximum braking force in Newtons, determining stopping power.
    tractive-effort: 612000 # Maximum tractive effort in Newtons, determining the train's pulling power.
    max-speed: 36           # Maximum speed of the train in meters per second (~129 km/h).
    max-acceleration: 2     # Maximum acceleration in meters per second squared (m/sÂ²).

# ============================================
# TRAIN CONTROL SYSTEM CONFIGURATION
# ============================================
control:
    pid:
        kp: 0.0200 # Proportional gain (P) - affects how strongly the controller reacts to errors.
        ki: 0.0001 # Integral gain (I) - helps correct steady-state errors over time.
        kd: 0.0025 # Derivative gain (D) - predicts future errors and smoothens control actions.
